# Database

In this demo we are used mongoDb.
So we need to install mongodb in our local system and for to visualize data need to install mongo compass.

# To Run application use

npm run dev -> for development mode
npm start -> for Production mode (Here i bind the build command in script directly)

# What can we expect from this App (Application)

-Basic server setup with express.
-Db connection with Mongo.
-Writing query's using mongoose (ORM)
-Complete user module (CRUD).
-Proper Authentication flow and Error handling.
-File uploading functionality with multer.

That all we are good to start backend development with node.
